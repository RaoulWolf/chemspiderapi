\title{Post a batch of monoisotopic masses and their ranges to obtain a query ID}
\usage{
post_mass_batch(
  mass,
  range,
  data_sources = NULL,
  order_by = "recordId",
  order_direction = "ascending",
  apikey = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mass}{A vector of (double) numbers corresponding to the atomic (monoisotopic) masses you are inquiring. Has to be within the range of [1,11000].}

\item{range}{A vector of (double) numbers corresponding to the ranges for the above masses. Has to be within the range of [0.0001,0.001].}

\item{data_sources}{Optional: A character vector specifying which data source to use. Use \code{chemspiderapi::get_datasources()} for a complete list of data sources. If none are specified (the default), will search all data sources, which can take substantially longer time to complete.}

\item{order_by}{A character vector indicating by which parameter to order. Defaults to \code{recordId}; see Details for options.}

\item{order_direction}{A character vector indicating in which direction to order; either \code{ascending} (default) or \code{descending}.}

\item{apikey}{A 32-character string with a valid key for ChemSpider's API services.}
}
\value{
Returns the queryId string as (named) character vector.
}
\description{
Functionality to post up to 20 monoisotopic masses and their range to obtain a \code{queryId} for use in \code{chemspiderapi::get_mass_batch_queryId_status()} and \code{chemspiderapi::get_mass_batch_queryId_results()}.
}
\details{
\emph{"If \code{dataSources} is not specified, all known sources are searched. This will take longer.\cr
\cr
Optionally, you can also submit \code{orderBy} and \code{orderDirection} to specify the sort order for the results. If you do not specify a value for \code{orderBy}, results are sorted by \code{recordId} by default.\cr
\cr
Valid values for \code{orderBy} are \code{recordId}, \code{massDefect}, \code{molecularWeight}, \code{referenceCount}, \code{dataSourceCount}, \code{pubMedCount}, \code{rscCount}.\cr
\cr
Valid values for \code{orderDirection} are \code{ascending}, \code{descending}."}
