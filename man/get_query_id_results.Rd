\usage{
get_query_id_results(
  query_id,
  status,
  start = NULL,
  count = NULL,
  apikey,
  coerce = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{query_id}{A valid 36-character ChemSpider query ID string; see Details.}

\item{status}{A character string indicating the query status as returned by \code{chemspiderapi::get_queryId_status()}}

\item{start}{Optional: An integer value giving the position from which to start the retrieval of query results. See Details.}

\item{count}{Optional: An integer value giving the the number of query results to retrieve. See Details.}

\item{apikey}{A 32-character string with a valid key for ChemSpider's API services.}

\item{coerce}{\code{logical}: should the list be coerced to a data.frame? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A character vector indicating the status of the query; see Details.
}
\description{
This function is used to retrieve the results of a ChemSpider query after \code{chemspiderapi::get_queryId_status()} returns \code{"Complete"}.
}
\details{
Before running \code{chemspiderapi::get_queryId_results()}, make sure \code{chemspiderapi::get_queryId_status()} returns \code{"Complete"}. In fact, this function will return \code{"NA"} if the status is not \code{"Complete"}.\cr
\cr
If the results have been truncated because there were more results than the maximum number of results permitted (by default, 10,000), a warning is issued. If this happens, you can split your requests into smaller batches.\cr
\cr
To batch your requests, call this function with two optional parameters, \code{start} and \code{count}. Both take integer values. \code{start} is the number of the record to start with (zero-based), and \code{count} is the number of records to return. For example, to request results 200-300, use \code{start = 200L} and \code{count = 100L}.
