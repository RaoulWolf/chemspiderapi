\title{Post a monoisotopic mass and its range to obtain a query ID}
\usage{
post_mass(
  mass,
  range,
  data_sources = NULL,
  order_by = "recordId",
  order_direction = "ascending",
  apikey = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mass}{A (double) number corresponding to the atomic mass (Da or g/mol) you are inquiring. Has to be within the range of [1,11000].}

\item{range}{The range for the above mass, also as (double) number. Has to be within the range of [0.0001,100].}

\item{data_sources}{Optional: A character vector specifying which data source to use. Use \code{chemspiderapi::get_datasources()} for a complete list of data sources. If none are specified (the default), will search all data sources, which can take substantially longer time to complete.}

\item{order_by}{A character vector indicating by which parameter to order. Defaults to \code{recordId}; see Details for options.}

\item{order_direction}{A character vector indicating in which direction to order; either \code{ascending} (default) or \code{descending}.}

\item{apikey}{A 32-character string with a valid key for ChemSpider's API services.}
}
\value{
Returns the queryId string as (named) character vector.
}
\description{
Functionality to POST an atomic mass and its range to obtain a \code{queryId} for use in \code{chemspiderapi::get_queryId_status()} and \code{chemspiderapi::get_queryId_results()}.
}
\details{
\emph{"Submit mass as a double between 1 and 11000 Atomic Mass Units, and a range between 0.0001 and 100 via POST. For example, if you specify a mass of 40 and a range of 5, all monoisotopic masses between 35 and 45 are searched.\cr
\cr
[...] If \code{dataSources} is not specified, all known sources are searched. This will take longer.\cr
\cr
Optionally, you can also submit \code{orderBy} and \code{orderDirection} to specify the sort order for the results. If you do not specify a value for \code{orderBy}, results are sorted by [\code{recordId}] by default.\cr
\cr
Valid values for \code{orderBy} are \code{recordId}, \code{massDefect}, \code{molecularWeight}, \code{referenceCount}, \code{dataSourceCount}, \code{pubMedCount}, \code{rscCount}.\cr
\cr
Valid values for \code{orderDirection} are \code{ascending}, \code{descending}."}
