\title{Get status for a formula batch query from ChemSpider}
\usage{
get_formula_batch_query_id_status(query_id, apikey, coerce = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query_id}{A valid 36-character ChemSpider query ID obtained from \code{post_formula_batch()}.}

\item{apikey}{A 32-character string with a valid key for ChemSpider's API services.}

\item{coerce}{\code{logical}: should the list be coerced to a \code{data.frame}? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Returns the query status as \code{list}, \code{data.frame} or character \code{vector}.
}
\description{
This function is used to return the status of a query from \code{post_formula_batch()}.
}
\details{
Call this endpoint with a \code{queryId} obtained from \code{post_formula_batch()}.\cr
\cr
If the query is still ongoing, returns a warning and a character vector of the query status as \code{Incomplete}. It is recommended to wait at least ten seconds before checking the status again.\cr
\cr
If the query is finalized, returns a data frame of the query status with \code{status}, \code{count} and \code{message}. The \code{status} can be either \code{Complete}, \code{Suspended}, \code{Failed}, or \code{Not Found}.\cr
\cr
\emph{"A status of Suspended can be caused if the results could not be compiled within a reasonable amount of time. Create a new filter request with more restrictive parameters.\cr
\cr
A status of Failed can be caused if the backend system could not compile the results. Create a new filter request and, if the same outcome occurs, apply more restrictive parameters.\cr
\cr
A status of Not Found can be caused if the Query ID has not been registered or has expired. Create a new filter request."}\cr
\cr
If both \code{count} and \code{message} are set to \code{FALSE}, \code{get_formula_batch_queryId_status()} returns the \code{status} as character vector.\cr
\cr
If the status is \code{"Complete"}, the results of the query can be obtained from \code{get_formula_batch_queryId_results()}.
